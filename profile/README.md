**Cetacean Research & Rescue Unit (CRRU)** is a marine conservation charity dedicated to the understanding, conservation, and protection of whales, dolphins, and porpoises in Scottish waters since 1997. 🐬 🐳 🐋 🌍

Technology is an important aspect of research both on and off the field. CRRU maintains its software in GitHub for projects such as research tools, infrastructure, websites, etc.
