The CRRU is a marine conservation charity dedicated to the study, conservation and understanding of UK whales, dolphins and porpoises (cetaceans) in northeast Scotland through scientific research, environmental education and the provision of a voluntary veterinary rescue service for marine wildlife in distress.

Technology is an important research aspect not only in the field. CRRU maintains its software in GitHub and other services for things such as tools used in research design and methodology, infrastructure, websites, etc. Most projects are private but may be made public in the future!

See the [**website**](https://www.crru.org.uk) for more information about the charity and its work and how you can get involved.
